# Capstone Project Sophmore Year 
# CCPA Compliance Log

This was my capstone project assignment. 

It was to include just a entry form that users could enter text that would be stored in a database.

It also needed a page that would allow a user to view all those entries with the ability to edit or delete them. 

I coded a simple login page that just used C# to change determine tableview pages would open between admin and user.

The admin page had access to edit and delete and the user did not.
